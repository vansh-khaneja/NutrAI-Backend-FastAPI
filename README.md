This repository guides to develop a Multimodal FastAPI application that leverages the CLIP model for analyzing images or text. The app performs semantic search to identify and retrieve nutritional information by querying a vector database, making it a powerful tool for multimodal data processing. The fastapi app is connected with web frontend-end written in Next.js for a better user interaction.
